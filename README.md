# Solution 2 (solution_2.cpp)

### To test the solution, it's possible to use the url https://onlinegdb.com/vfZU_kAMp and simply run the code, which is written in C++. No entry values should be provided by the user, and the output should be defined by the problem (doctest_2.cpp).

# Solution 7 (solution_7.sql)

### To test the solution, simply create two tables as specified in the question and insert names in each tables, some of them repeated to be sure that only the distinct names are being catched. Then run the solution and the output should be only the distinct names (doctest_7.sql).

# Solution 8 (solution_8.txt)

### This text file cointains the sequence of commands to each problem proposed in the question (no code here).

# Solution 9 (solution_9.cpp)

### To test the solution, it's possible to use the url https://onlinegdb.com/MD84-U7db , run the code and provide a string with no more than 1000 characters. Then, the output should be the lenght of the string (doctest_9.cpp).

# Solution 10 (solution_10.cpp)

### To test the solution, it's possible to use the url https://onlinegdb.com/BQj1HK8pa , run the code and provide a string with no more than 1000 characters. Then, the output should be the reverse string (doctest_10.cpp).
